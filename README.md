# TCO: The Chosen One
A Discord Bot with moderate feature-set, designed to be completely user-customisable.

To run it on your own server, you'll need a client-key, which you can get from discord.com. Place this in the format options file as specified. You may also want to delete the example user from the userdata file, and set your own custom status, though there's no need to.
