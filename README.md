# TCO: The Chosen One
A Discord Bot with moderate feature-set, designed to be completely user-customisable.

To run it on your own server, you'll need a client-key, which you can get from discord.com. Place this in the format options file as specified. Then change the admin password from the default. 

You may also want to delete the example user from the userdata file, and set your own custom status, though there's no need to.

As a general rule, .yml files are designed to be manually edited, whereas .json files are designed to be used solely by the software. They can of course all be edited manually if necessary.

All images in the Photography library are taken by me, and are free use. Add your own to either the Images or Photography libraries, depending on whether you want captions.
